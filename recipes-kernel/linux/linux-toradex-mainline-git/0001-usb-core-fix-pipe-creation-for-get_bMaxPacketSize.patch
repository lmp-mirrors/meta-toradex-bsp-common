Subject: [PATCH v1] usb: core: fix pipe creation for get_bMaxPacketSize0

When usb_control_msg is used in the get_bMaxPacketSize0 function, the
USB pipe does not include the endpoint device number. This can cause
failures when a usb hub port is reinitialized after encountering a bad
cable connection. As a result, the system logs the following error
messages:
usb usb2-port1: cannot reset (err = -32)
usb usb2-port1: Cannot enable. Maybe the USB cable is bad?
usb usb2-port1: attempt power cycle
usb 2-1: new high-speed USB device number 5 using ci_hdrc
usb 2-1: device descriptor read/8, error -71

The problem began after commit 85d07c556216 ("USB: core: Unite old
scheme and new scheme descriptor reads"). There
usb_get_device_descriptor was replaced with get_bMaxPacketSize0. Unlike
usb_get_device_descriptor, the get_bMaxPacketSize0 function uses the
macro usb_rcvaddr0pipe, which does not include the endpoint device
number. usb_get_device_descriptor, on the other hand, used the macro
usb_rcvctrlpipe, which includes the endpoint device number.

By modifying the get_bMaxPacketSize0 function to use usb_rcvctrlpipe
instead of usb_rcvaddr0pipe, the issue can be resolved. This change will
ensure that the endpoint device number is included in the USB pipe,
preventing reinitialization failures. If the endpoint has not set the
device number yet, it will still work because the device number is 0 in
udev.
