Subject: [PATCH 2/4] Revert "drm/panel-simple: drop use of data-mapping
 property"

This reverts commit d021d751c14752a0266865700f6f212fab40a18c.

Re-enable the data-mapping property which was already used in the
5.4-2.3.0 downstream kernel.

In addition to the revert set bpc from the data-mapping value
as a WARN_ON is printed if missing.
In addition to the revert have mapping pointing to the empty string to
prevent a kernel panic if data-mapping can not be read from the dt and
then an uninitialized pointer is used in strcmp.

Upstream-Status: Denied [Alternative solution being discused]
