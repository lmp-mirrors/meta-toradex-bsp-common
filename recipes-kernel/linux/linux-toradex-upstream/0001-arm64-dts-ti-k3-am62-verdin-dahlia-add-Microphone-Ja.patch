Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: ti: k3-am62-verdin-dahlia: add Microphone Jack to
 sound card

The simple-audio-card's microphone widget currently connects to the
headphone jack. Routing the microphone input to the microphone jack
allows for independent operation of the microphone and headphones.

This resolves the following boot-time kernel log message, which
indicated a conflict when the microphone and headphone functions were
not separated:
  debugfs: File 'Headphone Jack' in directory 'dapm' already present!

Upstream-Status: Submitted [https://lore.kernel.org/linux-devicetree/20250217144643.178222-1-eichest@gmail.com/]
Fixes: f5bf894c865b ("arm64: dts: ti: verdin-am62: dahlia: add sound card")
